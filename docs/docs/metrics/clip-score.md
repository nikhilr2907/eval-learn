# CLIP Score — Text-to-Image Alignment

## Overview

CLIP Score measures how well generated images match their text prompts. It uses
`logits_per_image` from the CLIP model, which is cosine similarity between the image
and text embeddings scaled by the model's learned temperature parameter (~100 for standard
OpenAI CLIP models). A higher score means generated images are more semantically aligned
with the prompts used to generate them.

Unlike FID, which measures distributional similarity to real images, CLIP Score measures
prompt faithfulness — whether the model still generates what it is asked to generate.
After concept erasure, CLIP Score can drop if the technique over-suppresses features
needed for general prompt adherence.

**Dataset:** TIFA dataset (a diverse set of text-image prompts for faithfulness evaluation)

CLIP Score is concept-agnostic — it works with any technique and any `erase_concept`.

## Compatible techniques

All techniques are compatible with CLIP Score. No concept restrictions.

## Configuration reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `clip_model_name` | `str` | ` "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14"` | CLIP model for embedding extraction. See supported models below. |
| `device` | `str \| None` | `None` | Device for CLIP inference. Auto-detects CUDA if `None`. |
| `limit` | `int \| None` | `300` | Maximum number of prompts from the TIFA dataset. |

### Supported CLIP models

- `openai/clip-vit-base-patch16`
- `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` (default — faster, slightly lower accuracy)
- `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` (higher accuracy)
- `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`

## Output

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `value` | `float` | Mean CLIP logit score across all prompt-image pairs. Computed as temperature-scaled cosine similarity — typical values for SD models fall between 20 and 35. Higher is better. Scores are only comparable across runs that use the same `clip_model_name`. |
| `details.per_image_scores` | `list[float \| None]` | Per-image scores in evaluation order. `None` for images that failed to load. |
| `details.evaluated_count` | `int` | Number of images successfully scored. |
| `details.total_count` | `int` | Total images attempted (includes failures). |

## Warnings

!!! warning "CLIP Score does not detect concept erasure"
    CLIP Score measures prompt adherence, not erasure. A model that still generates
    nudity but is otherwise high-quality will score well on CLIP Score. Always pair it
    with an erasure metric (ASR, ERR, UA_IRA).

!!! warning "Model consistency"
    If you compare CLIP Score across runs, ensure `clip_model_name` is the same in all
    runs. Different CLIP variants produce different absolute score ranges and are not
    directly comparable.
