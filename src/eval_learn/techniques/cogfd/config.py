    """Configuration for the Concept Graph Fine-tuning for Diffusion (CoGFD) unlearning technique.

    CoGFD erases harmful *combinations* of concepts from a diffusion model's UNet while
    preserving the ability to generate the individual component concepts in benign contexts.
    It does this through three complementary loss terms:

    - **Erasure loss** (``lambda_erase``): drives the model away from generating outputs
      matching any prompt in ``combination_prompts`` (or ``erase_concept`` if that list is
      empty).
    - **Preservation loss** (``lambda_preserve``): keeps the model's outputs for each
      concept listed in ``preserve_concepts`` close to the frozen reference model, so that
      individual concepts are not inadvertently degraded.
    - **Decoupling loss** (``lambda_decouple``): pushes intermediate UNet features apart
      for the harmful combination versus the individual components, weakening the learned
      association without destroying either concept independently.

    Attributes:
        model_id: HuggingFace model hub identifier for the base diffusion model to fine-tune.
        device: Torch device string (e.g. ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``).  When ``None`` the
            technique auto-selects the best available device at runtime.
        use_fp16: Whether to load and train in 16-bit floating point.  Reduces VRAM usage
            roughly 2x at the cost of a small numerical precision loss.

        erase_concept: Single-string fallback target concept used when
            ``combination_prompts`` is empty.  Typical values: ``"nudity"``,
            ``"violence"``.  When ``combination_prompts`` is non-empty this field
            no longer affects the training loss; it is used only for logging and
            runner-level metric routing (e.g. selecting concept-specific evaluation
            metrics).
        combination_prompts: A list of text prompts that each express a harmful
            *combination* of concepts to be erased (the concept logic graph).  These
            prompts are used together to define the erasure target so that no single
            phrasing is over-relied on.  If empty, ``[erase_concept]`` is used instead.
        preserve_concepts: Individual component concepts (e.g. ``["person", "nude"]``)
            whose independent generation ability should be retained after unlearning.
            Each entry is turned into a text prompt and used in the preservation loss.
            Leave empty to skip explicit preservation.

        lambda_erase: Weight on the combination erasure loss term.  Must be >= 0.
        lambda_preserve: Weight on the individual-concept preservation loss term.
            Defaults to 2.0 — intentionally higher than ``lambda_erase`` to prevent the
            fine-tuning from degrading the model's general generation quality.
            Must be >= 0.
        lambda_decouple: Weight on the feature decoupling loss term.  Must be >= 0.

        train_steps: Number of gradient-update steps for fine-tuning the UNet.
            Must be > 0.
        learning_rate: Optimiser learning rate.  Must be > 0.

        save_path: Optional filesystem path at which to save the modified UNet weights
            after fine-tuning.  When ``None`` the weights are kept in memory only and
            not persisted.

        num_inference_steps: Number of denoising steps used during evaluation / sample
            generation.
        guidance_scale: Classifier-free guidance scale applied during sample generation.
            Higher values increase prompt adherence at the cost of diversity.
