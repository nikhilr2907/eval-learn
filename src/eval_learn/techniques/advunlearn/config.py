class AdvUnlearnConfig(BaseConfig):
    """Configuration for AdvUnlearn (Adversarially Robust Concept Unlearning).

    AdvUnlearn alternates between two phases each training iteration:

    1. **Adversarial attack phase**: an adversarial prompt is crafted (via PGD or Fast-AT)
       in the text-encoder embedding space to maximally reconstruct the erased concept.
       This produces a worst-case prompt that is hard to defend against.
    2. **Unlearning update phase**: the model is fine-tuned to suppress generation of the
       erased concept *under* the adversarial prompt, while simultaneously replaying
       samples from a clean retention dataset to prevent catastrophic forgetting of
       unrelated concepts.

    The training target (the part of the model being fine-tuned) is controlled by
    ``train_method`` and ``component``.  Valid enumerated values for each string field
    are defined by the module-level constants (``TRAIN_METHODS``, ``RETAIN_DATASETS``,
    etc.) and are validated inside ``from_dict``.

    Attributes:
        model_id: HuggingFace hub identifier for the base diffusion model.  Fixed to
            ``CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4`` and excluded from ``__init__`` — it cannot
            be changed via config.
        device: Torch device string (e.g. ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``).
        use_fp16: Whether to load and train in 16-bit floating point.

        erase_concept: The target concept to erase from the model (e.g. ``"nudity"``).

        train_method: Which parameters of the text encoder / UNet to update.  Must be
            one of ``TRAIN_METHODS`` (e.g. ``"text_encoder_full"``, ``"xattn"``,
            ``"full"``) or match the pattern ``text_encoder_layer<digits>`` to target
            specific transformer layers (e.g. ``"text_encoder_layer012_910"``).

        dataset_retain: Name of the retention dataset used to replay clean samples
            during training.  Must be one of ``RETAIN_DATASETS``.
        retain_train: Strategy for interleaving retention samples with unlearning
            updates.  ``"iter"`` replays one retention batch per unlearning step;
            ``"reg"`` adds a regularisation term instead.  Must be one of
            ``RETAIN_TRAIN_METHODS``.
        retain_batch: Number of retention samples drawn per retention step.
            Must be > 0.
        retain_step: Number of gradient steps taken on the retention loss per
            unlearning iteration.  Must be > 0.
        retain_loss_w: Scalar weight applied to the retention loss term.

        start_guidance: Classifier-free guidance scale used when computing the
            unlearning target (the *frozen* reference model's prediction).
        negative_guidance: Guidance scale applied to the negative (erased-concept)
            direction during the unlearning loss computation.
        train_steps: Total number of unlearning iterations (each consisting of an
            adversarial attack phase followed by a model-update phase).  Must be > 0.
        learning_rate: Optimiser learning rate for the model-update phase.  Must be > 0.

        attack_method: Algorithm used to generate adversarial prompts.  ``"pgd"`` runs
            Projected Gradient Descent; ``"fast_at"`` is a single-step variant.  Must
            be one of ``ATTACK_METHODS``.
        attack_step: Number of iterative steps in the adversarial attack optimisation.
            Must be > 0.
        attack_lr: Step size (learning rate) used by the adversarial attack optimiser.
            Must be > 0.
        attack_type: Where in the token sequence the adversarial tokens are injected.
            Options include ``"prefix_k"`` (prepend *k* tokens), ``"suffix_k"`` (append),
            ``"replace_k"`` (replace first *k*), ``"add"`` (element-wise add to all),
            ``"mid_k"``, ``"insert_k"``, ``"per_k_words"``.  Must be one of
            ``ATTACK_TYPES``.
        attack_init: Initialisation strategy for adversarial token embeddings at the
            start of each attack phase.  ``"latest"`` reuses the tokens from the
            previous iteration for a warm start.
        attack_embd_type: Embedding space in which the adversarial perturbation is
            applied.  Currently only ``"word_embd"`` (word-embedding space) is
            supported.  Must be one of ``ATTACK_EMBD_TYPES``.
        adv_prompt_num: Number of independent adversarial prompts maintained in
            parallel during the attack phase.  Must be > 0.
        adv_prompt_update_step: How many unlearning steps to take before refreshing the
            adversarial prompt.  A value of 1 means the prompt is re-optimised every
            step.
        warmup_iter: Number of initial iterations to run *without* adversarial prompts
            (i.e. plain unlearning warm-up).  Must be strictly less than
            ``train_steps``.

        component: Which sub-module of the UNet is targeted for fine-tuning.
            ``"all"`` updates all parameters selected by ``train_method``; ``"ffn"``
            restricts to feed-forward layers; ``"attn"`` restricts to attention layers.
            Must be one of ``COMPONENTS``.
        norm_layer: Whether to include layer-normalisation parameters in the set of
            trainable parameters.

        ddim_steps: Number of DDIM denoising steps used when generating images during
            training (e.g. for computing the unlearning loss via a full forward pass).
        save_interval: Checkpoint save frequency in training iterations.

        save_dir: Optional directory path for saving model checkpoints.  When ``None``
            no checkpoints are written to disk.
        load_path: Optional path to a previously saved checkpoint from which to
            resume training.  When ``None`` training starts from the pretrained weights.
        num_inference_steps: Number of denoising steps used during evaluation / sample
            generation.
        guidance_scale: Classifier-free guidance scale applied at evaluation time.
