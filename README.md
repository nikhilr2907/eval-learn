# eval-learn

A benchmarking framework for evaluating concept-unlearning techniques in text-to-image diffusion models.

Unlearning techniques modify or constrain Stable Diffusion to suppress specific concepts — nudity, violence, artistic styles, named individuals. eval-learn provides a common interface to run, compare, and evaluate these techniques under consistent conditions.

## Techniques

| Technique | Key |
|-----------|-----|
| Erased Stable Diffusion | `esd` |
| Mass Concept Erasure | `mace` |
| Unified Concept Editing | `uce` |
| Selective Synaptic Dampening | `ssd` |
| Concept Ablation | `ca` |
| CoGFD | `cogfd` |
| TraSCE | `trasce` |
| SAFREE | `safree` |
| Safe Latent Diffusion | `sld` |
| AdvUnlearn | `advunlearn` |
| Concept Steerers | `concept_steerers` |
| SAeUron | `saeuron` |
| Reliable and Efficient Concept Erasure | `rece` |
| SalUn (Saliency Unlearning) | `salun` |
| Free Run (custom model) | `free_run` |

## Metrics

| Metric | Key | What it measures |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| ASR — I2P | `asr_i2p` | Attack success rate on I2P prompts |
| ASR — P4D | `asr_p4d` | Attack success rate via P4D adversarial prompts |
| ASR — MMA Diffusion | `asr_mma_diffusion` | Attack success rate via MMA-Diffusion GCG attack |
| ASR — Ring-A-Bell | `asr_ring_a_bell` | Attack success rate via genetic adversarial prompt discovery |
| Erasure Retention Rate | `err` | Concept erasure vs. unrelated concept retention |
| FID | `fid` | Image quality vs. COCO reference |
| CLIP Score | `clip_score` | Prompt-image alignment |
| UA-IRA | `ua_ira` | Unsafe concept alignment vs. retain concept alignment |
| TIFA | `tifa` | Text-image faithfulness via VQA |

## Installation

### 1. Install eval-learn

```bash
pip install eval-learn
```

### 2. Install technique packages

Technique implementations are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Unlearningltd/Packages). Clone the repo once, pull LFS files, then install only what you need:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/Unlearningltd/Packages
cd Packages
git lfs pull
```

```bash
pip install -e esd/
pip install -e mace/
pip install -e uce/
pip install -e ssd/
pip install -e ca/
pip install -e cogfd/
pip install -e trasce/
pip install -e saeuron/
pip install -e safree/
pip install -e concept-steerers/
pip install -e advunlearn/
pip install -e rece/
pip install -e salun_sd/
```

SLD is built into eval-learn via the `diffusers` library and requires no extra install.

### 3. Install metric packages

From the cloned `Packages` directory (see step 2 above):

```bash
pip install -e p4d/
pip install -e mma_diff/
pip install -e RING_A_BELL/
pip install -e Q16/
```

```bash
# NudeNet (nudity ASR)
pip install "eval-learn[asr]"

# FID / COCO metrics
pip install "eval-learn[fid,coco]"
```

### 4. Hugging Face authentication

Create a `.env` file in the directory you run `eval-learn run` from:

```
HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Quick start

Benchmarks are defined in a JSON or YAML config file:

```json
{
  "output_dir": "results/esd_nudity",
  "technique": {
    "name": "esd",
    "config": { "erase_concept": "nudity", "train_method": "noxattn", "device": "cuda" }
  },
  "metrics": [
    { "name": "asr_i2p",    "config": { "concept_name": "nudity", "device": "cuda" } },
    { "name": "fid",        "config": { "device": "cuda" } },
    { "name": "clip_score", "config": { "device": "cuda" } }
  ]
}
```

Run it:

```bash
eval-learn run --config config.json
```

Results are written to `output_dir` as JSON.

### Useful commands

```bash
eval-learn plugins   # list installed techniques and metrics
eval-learn models    # show the base model each technique targets
```

## Examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains ready-to-run configs for all techniques across nudity and violence concepts:

```
examples/
  nudity/     one config per technique (esd.json, mace.json, ...)
  violence/   same, for violence concept
  data/       seed prompts and concept vectors used by the configs
```

Run all nudity benchmarks in sequence:

```bash
python nudity_unlearning_demo.py
```

Run all violence benchmarks:

```bash
python nudity_unlearning_demo_violence.py
```
